# CS 320 Portfolio Submission

This repository contains selected artifacts from my work in CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance.

- Project One: Contact service files (`Contact.java`, `ContactService.java`, `ContactTest.java`, `ContactServiceTest.java`)
- Project Two: Summary and Reflections Report

Together, these artifacts demonstrate my ability to create unit tests, analyze different approaches to testing, and apply effective testing strategies.

## Reflection

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**  
I ensure functionality and security through unit tests, integration tests, and automated testing frameworks. I also follow secure coding practices like validating inputs, handling errors properly, and running dependency checks to catch vulnerabilities early.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**  
I break down user requirements into smaller tasks or user stories, clarify unclear areas, and design features that meet those expectations. Testing against requirements helps confirm that the final product aligns with what users actually need.

**How do I approach designing software?**  
I use modular, object-oriented design principles to make code reusable, maintainable, and easy to test. I also consider testing and security at the design stage so that the final program is both reliable and robust.
